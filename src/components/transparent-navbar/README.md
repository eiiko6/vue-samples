# Transparent navbar
The navbar is responsive and goes to the top of the page from a `730px` wide resolution.    
At `400px` wide the first icon dissapears.

The transparency is made using the css `::before` selector.

Each button is meant to be a `router-link` from vue-router except the top one which is a `#` for now.
